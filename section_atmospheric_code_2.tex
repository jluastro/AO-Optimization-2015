Only a few issues remain to complete the atmospheric code and put it into production. First, the existing IDL interface was initially designed without knowing how it would be called from Starfinder 2.0. With the current interface, we are calling the function many more times than is necessary and the resulting Starfinder 2.0 performance is inefficient. We have discussed ideas for re-working the interface and M. Britton is exploring other performance improvements. We view this as a low risk, moderate effort item as the interface design was not fleshed out prior to the beginning of Starfinder 2.0 development and several performance improvements are very obvious. Second, the current version of the atmospheric code in the repository has an installation bug. M. Britton is working to resolve this. Third, the current working version of the code has a limitation that PSFs can only be 181 $\times$ 181 pixels, which is too small for our purposes. M. Britton and G. Witzel are debugging this issue. These last two items are low risk, low effort items.
