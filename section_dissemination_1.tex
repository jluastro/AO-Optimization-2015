\section{Dissemination and Broader Impacts}
\label{sec:dissemination}

The AO Optimization team has taken extensive steps during Year 4 to 
package the project software into a cohesive tool set that can
efficiently be installed and edited by the entire AO Optimization
team. The AO Optimization tools consist of two distinct packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Atmospheric Code
\item Starfinder 2.0 (plus wrappers)
\end{itemize}
where the atmospheric code is considered a third party dependency for
Starfinder 2.0 (Figure \ref{fig:tool_schematic}).
The atmospheric code repository has been migrated from tOSC to
bitbucket (Figure \ref{fig:diss_git_repos}) and is now under the
adminstrative control of the Galactic Center Group. We have
installation notes that include dependencies (cfitsio, fftw-3.3,
plplot, doxygen, arroyo, boost, jpegsrc). Further more, M. Britton has
provided a series of test and example scripts for C++, IDL, and
command line calls to the atmospheric code.
