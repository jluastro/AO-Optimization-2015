Consistency check for coordinate conventions for the LGS and TTGS positions. Three cases are shown for different placements of the LGS and TTGS. For each case, 9 psfs are calculated in a grid with a spacing of 25”, generated from a perfect Keck PSF and our atmospheric modeling code. Case 1 shows a realization of anisoplanatism with both guide stars located at the center grid point. In case 2, both guide stars are located in the lower right;  in case 3, the LGS is located in the center and the TTGS is located in the lower right 35” away. All expectations for shape and Strehl dependencies are met.
