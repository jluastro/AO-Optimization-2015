Differences between the model and observed Zernike terms for the off-grid data points as a function of distance to the nearest model phasemap. Most terms are well-determined, but there seems to be high defocus terms once the point gets more than 30 pixels away from the nearest phasemap. This is crucial to know for the acquisition of a finely-gridded phase diversity data collection for the new grid.
