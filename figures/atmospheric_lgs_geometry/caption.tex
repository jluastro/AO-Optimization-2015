Example geometry showing the coordinate systems expected in Starfinder 2.0 (dashed) and the atmospheric code (solid) for the positions of the laser guide star (LGS) and tip/tilt guide star (TTGS). The IDL wrappers for the atmospheric code change conventions and interpret all positions relative to the detector origin.
