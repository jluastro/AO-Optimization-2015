\textit{Left}: "On-grid" points utilized to generate the third-order polynomial spline model for each Zernike coefficient for testing. \textit{Right}: "Off-grid" positions used to test the model generated from the "on-grid" points. Since we had directly observed data, these points were used to test the fidelity of our model.
