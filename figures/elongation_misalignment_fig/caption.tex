\textit{Left}: NIRC2 snapshot showing the elongation of the $L$-band core in the $y$-direction. The FWHM in $y$ is over 5 pixels (50 mas) longer than the FWHM in the $x$ direction. \textit{Right}: Image of the misaligned pupil before any OAP adjustment. It is clear that the pupil and the obscuration are not coincident with each other.
