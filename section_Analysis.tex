\begin{equation}
\Delta x_p = \frac{2 \eta D}{N}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta x_p$ is the pixel sampling in the pupil plan in units of {\em m pix$^-1$}, $\eta$ is the over-sampling factor (see below), $D$ is the diameter of the Keck telescope viewed through NIRC2's open pupil mask in meters, and $N$ is the size of the array in pixels needed to image the entire pupil on NIRC2.

\begin{equation}
\Delta x_F = \frac{\lambda}{2 \eta D}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta x_F$ is the focal plane pixel scale in units of radians per pixel, $\lambda$ is the wavelength in meters.



\begin{itemize}
\item 
\item oversampling factor - number of pixels per resolution element where os = 1 is Nyquist sampled. Resolution is defined as lambda/D??
