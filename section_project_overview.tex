\section{Project Overview and Status}
\label{sec:overview}

The AO Optimization project consists of the following top-level
objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Map NIRC2 instrumental aberrations.
\item Develop algorithms to predict atmospheric-induced aberrations
  from MASS/DIMM data.
\item Update NIRC2 distortion solution.
\item Upgrade Starfinder 2.0 to extract on-axis PSF from image with
  spatially varying PSF.
\item Upgrade Starfinder 2.0 to extract stellar astrometry and
  photometry using varying PSFs.
\item Apply AO Optimization to Galactic Center astrometry.
\item Disseminate AO Optimization to a broader community.
\end{enumerate}
