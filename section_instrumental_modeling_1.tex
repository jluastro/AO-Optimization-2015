\section{Instrumental Modeling}
\label{sec:instrument}

Our efforts with the instrumental modeling techniques continued forth
this year. We primarily focused on characterizing time variability,
acquiring additional data post-hardware adjustments, and creating an
interpolated instrumental model that delivered a grid of phase maps to
the entire team. 

\subsection{Time Variability}
We have taken a substantial amount of phase diversity data on NIRC2
since October 2012 (see full grid below). One of the main objectives
for taking such a large amount of data over time is to measure any
contribution to time variability at the four corners (hereafter called
the "extrema" points) of the detector to see how the $\Delta$RMS
changes as a function of time. To do this, we take data at the center
of the detector and at the four corners, taking the same positions
across multiple epochs. We center-subtract each of the four corners in
a respective epoch, and we measure the RMS between a given epoch and
the October 2012 epoch. That distribution is shown in the figure
below. Since this time variability analysis is complete for the full grid, there is at maximum a contribution of $\sim$60 nm RMS from time variability at the extreme points. Note that this is still far lower than the measured 190 nm RMS wavefront error measured at the extreme points.
