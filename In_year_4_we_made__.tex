In year 4 we made significant progress in developing a software suite that allows us to apply the PSF modeling tools to on-sky Galactic Center data. Builing on the prototype PSF-extraction presented last year we fully implemented PSF-modeling, PSF-extraction, and PSF-fitting routines. Furthermore, we gathered several versions of StarFinder1.6 with improvements in PSF extraction and post-processing from various sources and implemented and tested all modifications.
