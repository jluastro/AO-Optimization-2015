We also looked at the pairwise change in RMS for each extrema point and parameterized this by the time difference. The RMS difference increases, on average, when you move away from a time difference of 0 years, as expected. Therefore, the maximum amount of wavefront error that can be attributed to time variability is on order 60 nm RMS on this grid.
