We also performed a pairwise analysis between an extrama point and every other phase map for each epoch of phase diversity observations. The RMS difference increases, on average, as the  time difference increases. Again, the maximum contribution to the wavefront error that can be attributed to time variability is on order 60 nm RMS.

In addition to the total wavefront error, we also examined the defocus term for different filters in order to test for wavelength dependence. Figure \ref{fig:inst_wave_focus} shows the best fit focus position for seven different NIRC2 filters. There is no significant 
wavelength dependence.
