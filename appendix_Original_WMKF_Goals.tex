\section{Original WMKF Goals and Timeline}
The original project goals in the WMKF proposal are listed below. Goals that are completed, in progress, and incomplete are presented in green, yellow, and green, respectively.

\begin{itemize}
\item[1] Dramatically improve measurements obtained through Adaptive Optics (AO) hardware by developing the first methodology to determine spatial variations in image quality for AO systems on large (8-10 m) ground-based telescopes, using the premier such system at the W. M. Keck Observatory. This methodology, which we call “AO-Optimization”, will be carried out for both Natural Guide Star AO and Laser Guide Star AO. With factors of 4 to 100 improvements expected from measurements at the center and edges of the AO images, respectively, AO- Optimization greatly enhances the investments made to date in AO hardware at Keck and elsewhere.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[1-1] Develop \& test AO data analysis tools to work with variable point spread function (PSF)
    \item[1-2] Static (instrumental) PSF variations
        \begin{itemize}
        \item[1-2a] Carry out lab tests with AO fiber to measure static PSF
        \item[1-2b] Derive model for static PSF variations from fiber data 
        \item[1-2c] Test, optimize and characterize static PSF model
        \end{itemize}
    \item[1-3] Natural Guide Star (NGS) AO PSF variations
        \begin{itemize}
        \item[1-3a] Develop code to predict PSF variations for NGS-AO observations
            using Mauna Kea atmospheric profiler data, extending the proof of concept 
            work done at a smaller telescope to a larger telescope on a different site.
        \item[1-3b] Collect testing data from Keck NGS-AO and download associated MASS/DIMM data
        \item[1-3c] Test, optimize and characterize NGS-AO PSF model
        \end{itemize}
    \item[1-4] Laser Guide Star (LGS) AO PSF variations
        \begin{itemize}
        \item[1-4a] Develop code to predict PSF variations for LGS-AO observations
            using Mauna Kea atmospheric profiler data
        \item[1-4b] Collect testing data from Keck LGS-AO system and download
            associated MASS/DIMM data
        \item[1-4c] Test, optimize and characterize LGS-AO PSF model
        \end{itemize}
    \item[1-5] Evaluation: Assessment by external project advisory committee at year end 1-5a. 
    Assemble Committee at beginning of Year 1
        \begin{itemize}
        \item[1-5b] Review static instrumental PSF modeling 
        \item[1-5c] Review NGS-AO PSF modeling
        \item[1-5d] Review LGS-AO PSF modeling
        \end{itemize}

\section{EAC Recommendations from 2014 August}  
\begin{itemize}
\item NIRC2 Aberration Maps
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Explore Focus vs. wavelength
  \item Decompose phase maps into Zernikes, mitigate high spatial
    frequency residuals
  \end{itemize}
\item Simulations to Address Questions on Atmospheric Code
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Does the code accurately predict the PSF variation vs. distance to tip-tilt star?
  \item Does the code accurately predict the PSF variation vs. distance to the LGS?
  \item Does the outer scale (not included in atmosphere code) matter
    for the GC?
  \end{itemize}
\item Starfinder 2.0
  \begin{itemize}
  \item examine astrometric error vs. Cn2 profile develop algorithm to
    incorporate prior information on sources, what are the advantages?
  \end{itemize}
\item Simulations
  \begin{itemize}
  \item simulate crowded fields to test STF 2.0
  \item use simulations to update astrometric error budget and show
    improvements from AO Optimization
  \end{itemize}
\item Test STF 2.0 on Data
  \begin{itemize}
  \item archival NIRC2 data sets that are less crowded to verify algorithm
  \item use GC multi-epoch analysis to determine improvements from
    reducing false detections.
  \end{itemize}
\item Improve documentation and organization
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Review original goals and revise/prioritize project milestones
    mitigate personnel change-overs
  \end{itemize}
\item Dissemination
  \begin{itemize}
  \item identify and share with alpha-test team
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
