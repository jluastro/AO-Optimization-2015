\appendix{Original WMKF Goals and Timeline}
The original project goals in the WMKF proposal are listed below. Goals that are completed, in progress, and incomplete are presented in green, yellow, and green, respectively.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Dramatically improve measurements obtained through Adaptive Optics (AO) hardware by developing the first methodology to determine spatial variations in image quality for AO systems on large (8-10 m) ground-based telescopes, using the premier such system at the W. M. Keck Observatory. This methodology, which we call “AO-Optimization”, will be carried out for both Natural Guide Star AO and Laser Guide Star AO. With factors of 4 to 100 improvements expected from measurements at the center and edges of the AO images, respectively, AO- Optimization greatly enhances the investments made to date in AO hardware at Keck and elsewhere.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop & test AO data analysis tools to work with variable point spread function (PSF)
    \item Static (instrumental) PSF variations
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item Carry out lab tests with AO fiber to measure static PSF
        \item Derive model for static PSF variations from fiber data 
        \item Test, optimize and characterize static PSF model
        \end{enumerate}
