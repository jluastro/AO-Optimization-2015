\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple PSFs don't solve everything... you need to be careful about how you centroid PSFs on a grid relative to each other. 
\item The reference point problem - What is the difference between the difference of the true position of a star (or true separations between two stars on the sky) vs. some reference point in the PSF such as the large-box centroid, small-box centroid, or maximum-flux pixel. 
\item Aberrations introduce arbitrary shifts of these PSF/OTF derived (measurable) quantities w.r.t. the true position (or separation).
\end{itemize}
