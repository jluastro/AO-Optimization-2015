The AO correction was very stable in the night of August 7, 2014, and somewhat more variable in the night of April 27, 2013. On both datasets StarFinder2.0 runs stable in both single and variable PSF mode. It consistently shows a better performance in handling PSF halos than SF1.6. This is mainly due to the improved background and noise handling in the PSF extraction.
