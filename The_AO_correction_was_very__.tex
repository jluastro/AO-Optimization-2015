The AO correction was very stable in the night of August 7, 2014, and somewhat more variable in the night of April 27, 2013. On both datasets StarFinder2.0 runs stable in both single and variable PSF mode. The results of a run in variable PSF mode are shown in Fig. 16. It consistently shows a better performance in handling PSF halos than SF1.6. Fig. 17 shows the difference in the residual image, which is defined as image - model - background. The large improvements shown here are mainly due to the improved background and noise handling in the PSF extraction.

A more quantitative analysis comes to similar conclusions. We quantify the magnitude of the residual as:

\begin{equation}
\rm(fractional \; \; error) = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i,j}\rm{RES}^2_{i,j}}}{a}
\end{equation}
