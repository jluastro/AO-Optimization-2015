\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Galactic Center Science Objective
\item PSF Variability as a primary limitation (if you add spatially variable PSF, you get a drift of the reference frame)
\item Summarize Project: Instrumental Aberrations, Atmospheric Aberrations, Updated Distortion Solution, Tools to extract idealized on-axis PSF, tools to use this PSF + knowledge of the atmosphere to extract source positions/fluxes.
\end{enumerate}
