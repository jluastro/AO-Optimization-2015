\section{Introduction}

High-resolution observations of stars orbiting close to our Galaxy's supermassive black hole will enable unique tests of general relativity in the strong gravity regime. Adaptive optics technology currently provides the sharpest infrared view of the Galactic Center \cite{Ghez_2005}. However, the potential of this technology has not been fully exploited in terms of astrometric and photometric precision

\begin{enumerate}
\item Galactic Center Science Objective
\item PSF Variability as a primary limitation (if you add spatially variable PSF, you get a drift of the reference frame)
\item Summarize Project: Instrumental Aberrations, Atmospheric Aberrations, Updated Distortion Solution, Tools to extract idealized on-axis PSF, tools to use this PSF + knowledge of the atmosphere to extract source positions/fluxes.
\end{enumerate}
