\section{Instrumental Modeling}
Our efforts with the instrumental modeling techniques continued forth this year. We primarily focused on characterizing time variability, acquiring additional data post-hardware adjustments, and creating an interpolated instrumental model that delivered a grid of phase maps to the entire team.
\subsection{Time Variability}
We have taken a substantial amount of phase diversity data on NIRC2 since October 2012 (see full grid below). One of the main objectives for taking such a large amount of data over time is to measure any contribution to time variability at the four corners (hereafter called the ``extrema" points) of the detector to see how the $\Delta$RMS changes as a function of time. To do this, we take data at the center of the detector and at the four corners, taking the same positions across multiple epochs. We center-subtract each of the four corners in a respective epoch, and we measure the RMS between a given epoch and the October 2012 epoch. That distribution is shown in the figure below.

We also looked at the pairwise change in RMS for each extrema point and parameterized this by the time difference. The RMS difference increases, on average, when you move away from a time difference of 0 years, as expected. Therefore, the maximum amount of wavefront error that can be attributed to time variability is on order 60 nm RMS on this grid.
